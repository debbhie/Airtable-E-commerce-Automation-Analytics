## TABLE OF CONTENTS
- Project Overview[#project-overview]

## Project Overview
This project uses a supermarket transaction dataset to design an end-to-end order fulfillment and SLA monitoring system in Airtable.
The goal was to transform flat historical sales data into a scalable operational workflow that tracks order delivery performance, customer value, and service-level agreement (SLA) compliance using data modeling, automation, and dashboards.

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from a publicly available supermarket sales dataset, representing historical point-of-sale transactions.
The data includes order details, product categories, payment information, customer attributes, and transaction dates.

## Data Modeling & System Design
The original flat dataset was restructured into a relational data model to support analytics, automation, and scalability.
* Core Tables:
 - Customers
 - Orders
 - Products
 - Order Items (bridge table)

Relationships
- The Orders table is linked to the Customers table to enable customer-level analytics. (Customers to orders table: Many to one relationship)
- The Orders table is linked to the Products table through an Order Items table, creating a proper many-to-many relationship.
- Supporting fields and rollups were created to ensure accurate aggregation across tables.

## Key Fields & Metrics
** Orders Table
- Days to Deliver – Calculates how long it took to deliver an order.

## Problem Statements
This project was designed to answer the following business questions:
* Who are the supermarket’s high-value and repeat customers?
* Is the supermarket meeting its delivery SLA commitments?
* Where do delivery delays and SLA breaches occur?
* How can the order fulfillment workflow be automated?
* What is the supermarket’s monthly revenue performance?

## Automations Implemented
(Order Fulfillment & SLA Monitoring)
To simulate a real-world supermarket operations workflow, multiple event-driven automations were implemented in Airtable. These automations manage order progression, delivery tracking, and SLA breach detection using conditional triggers and record updates.

🔁 Automation 1: Payment → Fulfillment Order
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* Order Status = Paid
 - Actions:
* Update Fulfillment Status to Pending
  - Record payment confirmation by updating the relevant payment field/date
<img width="2554" height="1431" alt="auto fulfillment" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06004c7-7e0d-4b22-b067-f9fe0cb1e38c" />

* Purpose:
This automation ensures that once an order is paid, it immediately enters the fulfillment pipeline without manual intervention.

🚚 Automation 2: Shipment Update
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* Fulfillment Status = Shipped
- Actions:
* Update the order record to reflect shipment status
 - Capture shipment-related information (e.g., shipment date)
<img width="2553" height="1445" alt="auto shipped" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8966b204-254f-414f-90b0-699eebff0580" />

* Purpose:
This step simulates the logistics process by automatically recording when an order leaves the warehouse and enters transit.

📦 Automation 3: Delivery Completion
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* Fulfillment Status = Delivered
 - Actions:
* Update the order record to confirm delivery
 - Mark the order as completed
<img width="2548" height="1435" alt="auto delivery" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63da225c-ab06-4e29-93bc-db496a5fbcf5" />

* Purpose:
This automation closes the order lifecycle, ensuring delivery events are consistently recorded and downstream metrics (such as delivery duration and SLA performance) are updated.

⚠️ Automation 4: SLA Breach Alert
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* SLA Met ≠ Yes (i.e., SLA not met)
 - Actions:
* Automatically check the SLA Breach flag on the order record
<img width="2560" height="1438" alt="auto SLA" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f82017d4-73d8-46c1-b6d5-8779990d1f38" />

Purpose:

This automation identifies and flags orders that exceed the agreed SLA delivery timeframe, enabling quick visibility into operational failures and supporting SLA performance analysis.

### Why These Automations Matter
Together, these automations demonstrate the ability to:
* Design event-based workflows
* Separate operational state from analytical logic
* Handle historical (backdated) data correctly
* Automate repetitive operational tasks
* Support SLA tracking and performance monitoring at scale

## Dashboard (Airtable Interface)

## Key Insights

* Customer revenue is highly concentrated
A small percentage of customers (high-value segment) contribute the majority of total revenue, indicating strong revenue concentration and the importance of retention strategies.

* Most orders meet SLA, but breaches cluster at specific stages
While overall SLA performance is positive, breaches are concentrated around specific fulfillment stages, suggesting operational bottlenecks rather than systemic failure.

* Longer delivery timelines significantly increase SLA risk
Orders with extended delivery durations show a higher likelihood of missing SLA targets, highlighting the impact of logistics delays on service performance.

* Repeat buyers drive stability
Customers with multiple orders provide consistent revenue and are more likely to fall into higher-value segments, reinforcing the importance of loyalty and repeat purchase programs.

* Revenue trends vary by month
Monthly revenue shows fluctuations, suggesting potential seasonality or operational constraints impacting order volume and fulfillment capacity.

## Recommendations

* Prioritize high-value customers in fulfillment workflows
Fast-track fulfillment for high-value and repeat customers to improve retention and maximize lifetime value.

* Investigate fulfillment stages with the highest SLA breaches
Focus process improvement efforts on stages where SLA breaches are most frequent, such as packing or shipping delays.

* Set realistic SLA targets based on historical performance
Use observed delivery timelines to recalibrate SLA targets, balancing customer expectations with operational capacity.

* Introduce proactive SLA alerts
Extend automation to flag orders before SLA deadlines are missed, enabling corrective action rather than reactive responses.

* Leverage dashboards for continuous monitoring
Encourage operational teams to use dashboards daily to monitor delays, while executives use high-level KPIs to guide strategic decisions.
